          <p>
            Here's the idea I keep bringing to the stage, whether the room is
            programme teams, founders, or a data community: most operational pain
            isn't a broken team, it's a few bad seams, and almost no one is
            trained to see the workflow as a system waiting to be built. That's
            the talk under all the talks.
